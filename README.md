# Clicker! App

To take our first steps in software development, we have created “Clicker!”.
It displays "Hello Kotlin!" at the press of a button. 

# Idea behind it:
  With this on Git ,we hope any beginner who is struggling to make any sort of android app at all, will find this helpful. 
  Nostalgic to our senior coders and drop of curiosity for us, with this project, we take our first step into the world of Kotlin Programming.

# Technologies used 
  Android Studio 
  Basic Kotlin boilerplate code
